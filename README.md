# SC1015 Mini-Project
This mini-project is done for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) in AY22/23 Semester 2. 

## Team Members (A139 Team 5)

## Introduction
The dataset used for this mini-project is taken from [Student Alcohol Consumption](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption) dataset on Kaggle.

### Objective
The objective for this mini-project is to find out the factors that could affect a student's grades, and thereafter try some machine learning techniques to see if we can predict a student's grade band given some student's data.

### Significance
There can be many factors that affect a student's academic grades, such as his/her family background and lifestyle. By considering these factors, this mini-project may be significant in identifying weaker performing students so that additional help can be rendered to them early and help them score better grades.

## Summary
For a walkthrough of the project, please view the [Jupyter notebook](/student_grades_prediction.ipynb) in this repository.

The following sections closely follows the notebook and summarises:
1. Data Preprocessing: preparing of dataset for EDA
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: analysis of datasets, correlations and relationships
3. Data Preparation: cleaning of dataset based on findings of EDA
4. Preliminary Machine Learning (Methodology): explore multiple machine learning techniques
5. Machine Learning (Experiments): further experiments of identified machine learning models
6. Conclusion

For detailed steps in each section, please view the notebook.
